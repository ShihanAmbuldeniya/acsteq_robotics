# Line Following Robot

#### Description:
 This robot is programed to follow black lines in a white color background using a algorithm that I've developed. The robot is calibrated before the trial runs on the platform. The line follower detects and follows the black line using an algorithm called **PID** (PID stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller)
